# AI-Based Attendance Management System (Frontend)

## Project Overview
The AI-Based Attendance Management System is a smart solution designed to automate student attendance using facial recognition technology. This phase of the project focuses **only on the frontend implementation**, which provides the user interface for interacting with the system.

The frontend enables Admins, Teachers, and Students to access dashboards, capture attendance, and view attendance records. The backend services and AI-based facial recognition module are currently under development and will be integrated in later stages.
